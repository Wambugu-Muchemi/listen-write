![EscucharUnSusurro Logo](EscucharUnSusurro/susurro/logo.jpg)

## Overview

EscucharUnSusurro is a powerful toolkit designed for audio transcription and in-depth analysis. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection), and AI language models like GPT-3 and Google Palm APIs, this project transforms raw audio into valuable insights.

## Key Features

### 1. Whisper ASR Integration

- **Whisper Accuracy:** Harnesses the advanced Whisper ASR model for highly accurate audio transcription.
  
### 2. Silero VAD Implementation

- **Efficient Preprocessing:** Silero VAD is employed to eliminate non-speech segments, optimizing the audio for subsequent processing.

### 3. Intelligent Segmentation

- **Enhanced Processing:** Segments the audio stream for efficient parallel processing, reducing computational load.

### 4. AI-Powered Analysis

- **GPT-3 Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI GPT-3 API for natural language understanding and context-aware insights.
- **Google Palm APIs:** Leverages Google Palm APIs for additional context and semantic analysis.

### 5. SQLite Database Management

- **Structured Data Storage:** Utilizes SQLite for organized storage and retrieval of transcribed information.
- **Data Deduction:** Extracted insights are cataloged for easy access and analysis.

### 6. Data Visualization

- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly:** Employs powerful visualization tools for clear and informative data representation.
- **Dynamic Charts:** Provides interactive charts for exploring trends and patterns.

### 7. Whisper Model Optimization

- **Pickling Whisper Model:** Enhances performance by pickling the Whisper model for faster execution.
