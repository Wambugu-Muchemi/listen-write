00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
and says, how do I get to Dublin?

00:01.920 --> 00:03.880
And the answer that comes back is,

00:03.880 --> 00:05.680
well, I wouldn't start from here, Sonny.

00:05.680 --> 00:09.280
That is to say, much of political philosophy

00:09.280 --> 00:12.760
develops theories that take no account

00:12.760 --> 00:15.080
of where we actually are,

00:15.080 --> 00:17.680
and how the theories that people argue about

00:19.600 --> 00:22.280

00:25.320 --> 00:28.000
made by other scholars,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.640
Thomas Piketty in his book,

argues for a 4% global wealth tax.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.520
Well, good luck with that.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.360
Who's gonna implement a 4% global wealth tax?

00:40.360 --> 00:45.360
So when I think about normative questions,
