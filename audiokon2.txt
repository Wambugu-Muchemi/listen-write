Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air quality alerts throughout the U.S. Skylines from Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray and smoggy. And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside. We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter DiCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor DiCarlo. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. I'm so glad to be here. I'm so glad to be here.

US getting hit right now is a little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change moving forward this is something that's going to happen more frequently. That's Peter DeCarlo, Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Professor DeCarlo, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us. Thank you for having me.

Good morning. So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away? Well, there's a couple of things. The season has been pretty dry already. And then the fact that we're getting hit in the U.S. is because there's a couple of weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there. So what is it in this haze that...

makes it harmful? And I'm assuming it is harmful. It is, it is. The levels outside right now in Baltimore are considered unhealthy and most of that is due to what's called particulate matter, which are tiny particles, microscopic, smaller than the width of your hair, that can get into your lungs and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular system, and even your neurological, your brain. What makes this particularly harmful? Is it the volume of...

particulate? Is it something in particular? You know, what is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit more? Yeah, so the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have, was reaching levels of what are, in science speak, 150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than 10 times what the annual average should be, and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24-hour average. And so the concentrations of these particles...
