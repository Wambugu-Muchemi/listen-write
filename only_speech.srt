1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
and says, how do I get to Dublin?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,880
And the answer that comes back is,

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,680
well, I wouldn't start from here, Sonny.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
That is to say, much of political philosophy

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,760
develops theories that take no account

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,080
of where we actually are,

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,680
and how the theories that people argue about

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,600
in the journals and in the literature

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,280
actually could be implemented in the world, if at all.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,320
And this spills over into normative arguments

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,000
made by other scholars,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
Thomas Piketty in his book,

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,600
Capital in the 21st Century,

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,480
argues for a 4% global wealth tax.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,520
Well, good luck with that.

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,360
Who's gonna implement a 4% global wealth tax?

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,360
So when I think about normative questions,
